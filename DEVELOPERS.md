## Contribution Rules

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

Using AI to write code is discouraged.

- The use of AI is limited to CSS generation or information research.

- AI generated code must undergo rigorous review by a team member.

- AI should not be used to write critical code (security, authentication, network infrastructure).

### Code Conventions

FairPlay follows consistent code practices to maintain code quality.

1. Readability: code must be understandable by any contributor.

2. Language: all variable, functions, and class names, as well as comments must be in American English.

3. Comments: comment on complex parts of the code.

4. Tests: any new code added must be accompanied by unit tests when applicable.

5. Dependency Management: avoid adding unnecessary libraries, prefer native and lightweight solutions.

### Security & Quality

- No API keys or sensitive data must be committed to the repository. Use a .env file instead.

- Any detected security vulnerability must be reported immediately and fixed as a priority.

- The project aims for transparency: major decisions (technical or organizational) must be discussed publicly on Discord.

### Naming Conventions

#### Variable Naming Convention 

All variables must be in **camelCase**, except constants which can be in all caps. 

React components and pages must be in **PascalCase**.

#### File and Folder Naming Convention

All files and folders must follow the same naming convention to avoid errors, especially on case-sensitive systems (Linux).

**General Rules**

- Follow **kebab-case** or **camelCase**.

- Avoid spaces, accents, and special characters.

- The file extension must always be lowercase.

**Specific rules for Next.js/React**

React component files must always be in **PascalCase**.

eg. ``VideoPlayer.tsx``, ``UserCard.tsx``

Utility, hooks, and service files must remain in **camelCase**.

eg. ``useFetch.ts``, ``authService.ts``

**Folders**

Folders should be in **kebab-case**.

### Linting & Formatting
 
Ensure your code passes linting and formatting checks before submitting a PR:

```sh
npm run lint # or pnpm lint
npm run format # or pnpm format
```

This project uses Prettier for formatting and ESLint for linting to maintain a consistent style across the codebase.
